Building with the Debug configuration can produce some exceptions (To be fixed)

Run:
    cd Example/Example_3
    ../../build/App/ore Input/ore.xml


Changes: 
    After the changes already made by Matlogica so ORE and QuantLib use AADC, the following changes were made as part of this project

    OREAnalytics/orea/app/oreapp.cpp -> only commented unnecessary code (eg. code after our test)
    OREAnalytics/orea/app/reporwriter.cpp -> all code contained in #if AADC_QL_RUN (lines 70 to 285)
    OREData/ored/marketdata/market.hpp -> added AADC data related functions (lines 229 to 236)
    OREData/ored/marketdata/marketimpl.hpp -> added AADC data related functions implementations (lines 198 to 280)
    QuantLib/ql/termstructures/yield/discountcurve.hpp -> some commented variations in markVecAs**** functions
